I was born and raised in Minnesota, USA.  I'm a homegrown midwesterner and am an avid Minnesota sports fan (for better or for worse).  Outside of projects and work, my hobbies include golfing, brewing beer, and hanging out with interesting people.

I graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelors degree in Computer Engineering and I expect to receive my masters degree from Purdue University in Electrical and Computer Engineering this May with a focus in Computer Architecture.  

Post graduation, I will be employed as a digital hardware engineer for Qualcomm, working on their image signal processor.
